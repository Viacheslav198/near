9. Next, you need to connect your Ledger nano s wallet to the computer using the cable that is included in the kit. The message on the screen says that after connecting the wallet to the computer, select “Configure a new device”, and come up with a PIN code from 4 to 8 digits, to confirm the PIN code, click on the “checkmark”. It is also written on this screen that with the PIN code you will go into the wallet itself, that 8 digits for the PIN code will help to maximize the security of the wallet and the most important “NEVER USE A WALLET IF A PIN OR A PRIVATE PHRASE ALREADY WRITTEN 24 WORDS”, Only you come up with a PIN code, and a private key of 24 words, the wallet generates automatically when you first set up the wallet.

10. On the next screen it is written how to record your private phrase of 24 words, you need to record them from your wallet, strictly in the order they appear, 1 WORD, 2 WORD and so on. Keep your private key in a safe place, this is the most valuable thing that a hardware wallet gives out.
